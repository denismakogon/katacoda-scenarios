That's it! You have completed your first *Fn Project scenario* and you are now familiar with the Fn server and the CLI.

The fastest way to experience Fn is to follow our [quickstart guide](https://github.com/fnproject/fn#quickstart), 
or you can jump right in to our [documentation](https://github.com/fnproject/fn/blob/master/docs/README.md), 
[API Docs](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/fn/master/docs/swagger.yml), 
or hit us up in our [Slack Community](http://slack.fnproject.io/)!
