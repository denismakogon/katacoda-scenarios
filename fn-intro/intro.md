Welcome to your the Fn Project scenarios!

Fn is an event-driven, open source, Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) compute platform that you can run anywhere. Some of its key features:

 - Open Source
 - Native Docker: use any Docker container as your Function
 - Supports all languages
 - Run anywhere
   - Public, private and hybrid cloud
   - Import Lambda functions and run them anywhere
 - Easy to use for developers
 - Easy to manage for operators
 - Written in Go
 - Simple yet powerful extensibility

In this tutorial we will go "from zero to serverless": will create our first serverless function, build it, deploy it, call it!
Enjoy!
